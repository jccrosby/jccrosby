### Hi there! :wave: 

I'm John Crosby - former professional cook turned keyboard jockey. I've left the fire and knives for a cushy chair and keyboard so I can make great things for great people. I'm a dad, husband, son, Principal Engineer at MLB, & kettlebell swinger. Also learning to fly fish in West Michigan.🏋️‍♂️🖥🎣
